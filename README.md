# Social-Solution-Service

### Description

This project is about code refactoring. This means that I have to restructure the coding without affecting the original intended functions of the code. In this challenge, I am to assume the role of a junior developer to refactor the code of a marketing agency to make it more accessible.

Accessibility is an important aspect of web development because not only it improves SEO - search engine optimization - rankings, but also, accomodates to people with disability. Websites with good SEO are likely to place higher in search engines, such as google.
